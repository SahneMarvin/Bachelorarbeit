	volume = {2},
	abstract = {Numerous scientific research and engineering programs are being carried out globally in an effort to monitor environmental degradation, natural and anthropogenic disasters. These are part of a process to predict possible catastrophic events and help minimize their devastating impact on the environment and human life. Many of these programs, sometimes referred to as Early Warning Systems ({EWSs}), have been documented with detailed information on approach and technology utilization in the areas of sensor design for realtime multiple-source data collection, data transmission, evaluation and analysis, timely dissemination of early warning information and efficient response to such information.While some {EWSs} are indispensable in our efforts for environmental sustainability, others have not performed as expected or designed. This paper examines the literature on {EWSs}, the level of utilization of remote sensing technology and the potential trends for future systems. An evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the different systems was performed. Status and processes were reviewed for early warning systems, as related to land degradation, biodiversity, atmospheric and air quality, aquatic environments and freshwater quality assessment.The review indicated not all monitoring systems constituted fully integrated {EWSs}, and not all natural or anthropogenic pollution categories and consequent disasters have working {EWSs}. Remote sensing and related technologies have been successfully used to analyze and predict adverse impacts related to land degradation and certain physical and biological pollution variables related to water quality. Advances in sensor technologies have also resulted in more reliable, high frequency and automated samplers for data collection in water quality studies. Europe and North America have some of the most advanced {EWSs}, while {EWS} applications in Africa and Asia have improved considerably in recent years. {EWSs} have generally been reliable in helping reduce some of the negative impacts of environmental degradation, pollution and disasters.},

	abstract = {The design, implementation, management, and veriﬁcation of landslide early warning systems ({LEWSs}) are gaining increasing attention in the literature and among government oﬃcials, decision makers, and the public. Based on a critical analysis of nine main assumptions that form the rationale for landslide forecasting and early warning, we examine 26 regional, national, and global {LEWSs} worldwide from 1977 to August 2019. We ﬁnd that currently only ﬁve nations, 13 regions, and four metropolitan areas beneﬁt from {LEWSs}, while many areas with numerous fatal landslides, where landslide risk to the population is high, lack {LEWSs}. Operational {LEWSs} use information from rain gauge networks, meteorological models, weather radars, and satellite estimates; and most systems use two sources of rainfall information. {LEWSs} use one or more types of landslide forecast models, including rainfall thresholds, distributed slope stability models, and soil water balance models; and most systems use landslide susceptibility zonations. Most {LEWSs} have undergone some form of veriﬁcation, but there is no accepted standard to check the performance and forecasting skills of a {LEWS}. Based on our review, and our experience in the design, implementation, management, and veriﬁcation of geographical {LEWSs} in Italy, we conclude that operational forecast of weather-induced landslides is feasible, and it can help reduce landslide risk. We propose 30 recommendations to further develop and improve geographical {LEWSs}, and to increase their reliability and credibility. We encourage landslide forecasters and {LEWSs} managers to propose open standards for geographical {LEWSs}, and we expect our work to contribute to this endeavour.},

	abstract = {Landslides are a common global geohazard that lead to substantial loss of life and socio-economic damage. Landslides are becoming more common due to extreme weather events and the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance, and thus, they are threatening sustainable development in many vulnerable areas. Previous studies on fatal landslides have focused on inventory development; spatial and temporal distributions; the role of precipitation or seismic forcing; and human impacts. However, climatologic, topographic, and anthropogenic variables featuring fatal landslides at a global scale have been mostly neglected. Here, using the global fatal landslide database, we evaluate the characteristics of landslides induced by natural and anthropogenic factors with respect to topographic, climatic, and anthropogenic factors, drawing attention to their persistent spatial patterns. The majority of natural (69.3\%) and anthropogenic (44.1\%) landslides occur in mountainous areas in tropical and temperate regions, which are also characterized by the highest casualty rates per group, 66.7\% and 43.0\%, respectively. However, they significantly differ in terms of their morphometric footprint. Fatal landslides triggered by natural variables occur mostly in the highest portions of the topographic profile, where human disturbance is minimal. As for their anthropogenic counterpart, these failures cluster at much lower altitudes, where slopes are gentler, but human intervention is higher due to a higher population density. This observation points towards land cover changes being a critical factor in landscape dynamics, stressing the human pressure as a discriminant cause/effect term for natural vs. human-induced landslide fatalities.},

	abstract = {Building landslide resilience at a community scale is the most effective way to protect people against landslides. But building resilience at a community scale can become difficult, given the large spatial scale spanned by locations vulnerable to landslides and the number of communities that might get affected. So, in this chapter, we discuss how to build community-scale landslide resilience using a citizen-science approach. The potential of citizen-science approaches for building landslide resilience at the community level is immense, given that the citizens become resources to build resilience. Yet challenges exist in this approach as novel tools and operationalizing methods are seldom found in the literature. Therefore, this chapter examines the requirements, solutions, and dimensions of landslide resilience and presents a framework to strengthen community-scale resilience. The framework addresses how citizens can be engaged before, during, and after a disaster. This chapter also presents a few example tools used to operationalize this theoretical framework, such as Landslide tracker mobile app, Amritakripa mobile app, social media data analysis, and community involvement. It also examines the difficulties found while applying the citizen science approach in two case study locations in India: Munnar in the Western Ghats and Chandmari in Sikkim. This chapter and the case study can help policymakers, community leaders, change makers, administrative officials, and researchers in disaster management.},

	abstract = {Due to the recent emergence of invasive mosquito species and the outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases in Europe, research on the ecology and diversity of the mosquito fauna has returned to scientific agendas. Through a nationwide surveillance programme in Germany, mosquitoes have been monitored actively by systematically operated traps since 2011, and passively by the ‘Mückenatlas’ (mosquito atlas) citizen science project launched in 2012. To assess the performance of both monitoring methods we compared the two respective datasets with regard to habitat coverage, species composition and the ability to detect invasive mosquitoes. The datasets include observations from the beginning of the project until the end of 2017. We found significant differences in species composition caused by land use types and the participants’ recording activity. Active monitoring performed better in mapping mosquito diversity, whereas passive monitoring better detected invasive species, thereby using data from private premises scientists usually cannot access. Synthesis and applications. Active and passive monitoring is complementary. Combining them allows for the determination of mosquito diversity, efficient detection of emerging invasive species and the initiation of rapid-response actions against such invaders. The ‘Mückenatlas’ sets an example for the usefulness of citizen science when included in a national monitoring programme, an approach that may be worth copying for tackling the global spread of arthropod vectors of disease agents.},

	abstract = {Software 2.0 refers to the fundamental shift in software engineering where using machine learning becomes the new norm in software with the availability of big data and computing infrastructure. As a result, many software engineering practices need to be rethought from scratch where data becomes a first-class citizen, on par with code. It is well known that 80--90\% of the time for machine learning development is spent on data preparation. Also, even the best machine learning algorithms cannot perform well without good data or at least handling biased and dirty data during model training. In this tutorial, we focus on data collection and quality challenges that frequently occur in deep learning applications. Compared to traditional machine learning, there is less need for feature engineering, but more need for significant amounts of data. We thus go through state-of-the-art data collection techniques for machine learning. Then, we cover data validation and cleaning techniques for improving data quality. Even if the data is still problematic, hope is not lost, and we cover fair and robust training techniques for handling data bias and errors. We believe that the data management community is well poised to lead the research in these directions. The presenters have extensive experience in developing machine learning platforms and publishing papers in top-tier database, data mining, and machine learning venues.},

The factors chosen that influence landslide occurrence were: topographic slope, topographic aspect, topographic curvature and distance from drainage, all from the topographic database; lithology and distance from lineament, taken from the geologic database; land use from Landsat Thermatic Mapper ({TM}) satellite images; and the vegetation index value from {SPOT} {HRV} (High-Resolution Visible) satellite images. Landslide hazardous areas were analyzed and mapped using the landslide-occurrence factors employing the probability–frequency ratio method using the all factors. To assess the effect of these factors, each factor was excluded from the analysis, and its effect verified using the landslide location data. As a result, all factors had relatively positive effects, except lithology, on the landslide susceptibility maps in the study area.},

	abstract = {Nepal is a mountainous, less developed kingdom that straddles the boundary between the Indian and Himalayan tectonic plates. In Nepal, landslides represent a major constraint on development, causing high levels of economic loss and substantial numbers of fatalities each year. There is a general consensus that the impacts of landslides in countries such as Nepal are increasing with time, but until now there has been little or no quantitative data to support this view, or to explain the causes of the increases. In this paper, a database of landslide fatalities in Nepal has been compiled and analysed for the period 1978–2005. The database suggests that there is a high level of variability in the occurrence of landslides from year to year, but that the overall trend is upward. Analyses of the trends in the data suggest that there is a cyclicity in the occurrence of landslide fatalities that strongly mirrors the cyclicity observed in the {SW} (summer) monsoon in South Asia. Perhaps surprisingly the relationship is inverse, but this is explained through an inverse relationship between monsoon strength and the amount of precipitation in the Hill District areas of Nepal. It is also clear that in recent years the number of fatalities has increased dramatically over and above the effects of the monsoon cycle. Three explanations are explored for this: land-use change, the effects of the ongoing civil war in Nepal, and road building. It is concluded that a major component of the generally upward trend in landslide impact probably results from the rural road-building programme, and its attendant changes to physical and natural systems.},

Over the past decade and a half, we have seen the emergence of typologies, definitions, and criteria for qualifying citizen science. Yet, citizen science as a field seems somewhat resistant to obeying a limited set of definitions and instead attracts discussions about what type of activities and practices should be included in it. We explore how citizen science has been defined differently, depending on the context. We do that from a particularly European perspective, where the variety of national and subnational structures has also led to a diversity of practices. Based on this background, we track trade-offs linked to the prioritisation of these different objectives and aims of citizen science. Understanding these differences and their origin is important for practitioners and policymakers. We pay attention to the need for definitions and criteria for specific contexts and how people in different roles can approach the issue of what is included in a specific interpretation of citizen science.},

	abstract = {Within the academic and popular discussion of neogeography, it is routinely argued that the process of producing and using geographical information has been fundamentally democratised. Neogeography, in contrast to ‘established geography’, especially uses the argument that it is for anyone, anywhere, and anytime. Similar arguments have been used to praise the growth in Web {GIS} since the mid-1990s and seem to be persistent in the conceptualisation of these technologies. However, what is the nature of this democracy, and to what extent do the technologies that are used in neogeography fulfil this democratisation promise? In this contribution the framework offered by Andrew Feenberg in his critical theory of technology, and especially his call for ‘deep democratisation’, is used to provide a critique of these assertions of the nature of neogeography. The analysis shows that, unlike early critical {GIS} and the literature on participatory {GIS}, the analysis of neogeography adopted an instrumentalist interpretation of the technology and its applications. This view claims that technology is value free and that there is a separation between means and ends. This type of argument ignores and disguises the values that are integrated inexorably in advanced technologies. Once the values are exposed and discussed, neogeography becomes far less exciting and transformative. It becomes clear that there is a separation between a technological elite and a wider group of uninformed, labouring participants who are not empowered through the use of the technology. There are also multiple obstacles that limit the democratic potential of neogeography. The analysis progresses by considering the hierarchy of hacking, understood here as the ability to alter and change the meaning and use of a specific technological system. This hierarchy further explains the democratisation potentialities and limits of neogeography. Because of the reduced barriers, neogeography does offer some increased level of democratisation but, to fulfil this potential, it requires careful implementation that takes into account social and political aspects.},
