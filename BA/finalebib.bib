	abstract = {Landslides are a common global geohazard that lead to substantial loss of life and socio-economic damage. Landslides are becoming more common due to extreme weather events and the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance, and thus, they are threatening sustainable development in many vulnerable areas. Previous studies on fatal landslides have focused on inventory development; spatial and temporal distributions; the role of precipitation or seismic forcing; and human impacts. However, climatologic, topographic, and anthropogenic variables featuring fatal landslides at a global scale have been mostly neglected. Here, using the global fatal landslide database, we evaluate the characteristics of landslides induced by natural and anthropogenic factors with respect to topographic, climatic, and anthropogenic factors, drawing attention to their persistent spatial patterns. The majority of natural (69.3\%) and anthropogenic (44.1\%) landslides occur in mountainous areas in tropical and temperate regions, which are also characterized by the highest casualty rates per group, 66.7\% and 43.0\%, respectively. However, they significantly differ in terms of their morphometric footprint. Fatal landslides triggered by natural variables occur mostly in the highest portions of the topographic profile, where human disturbance is minimal. As for their anthropogenic counterpart, these failures cluster at much lower altitudes, where slopes are gentler, but human intervention is higher due to a higher population density. This observation points towards land cover changes being a critical factor in landscape dynamics, stressing the human pressure as a discriminant cause/effect term for natural vs. human-induced landslide fatalities.},

	abstract = {Building landslide resilience at a community scale is the most effective way to protect people against landslides. But building resilience at a community scale can become difficult, given the large spatial scale spanned by locations vulnerable to landslides and the number of communities that might get affected. So, in this chapter, we discuss how to build community-scale landslide resilience using a citizen-science approach. The potential of citizen-science approaches for building landslide resilience at the community level is immense, given that the citizens become resources to build resilience. Yet challenges exist in this approach as novel tools and operationalizing methods are seldom found in the literature. Therefore, this chapter examines the requirements, solutions, and dimensions of landslide resilience and presents a framework to strengthen community-scale resilience. The framework addresses how citizens can be engaged before, during, and after a disaster. This chapter also presents a few example tools used to operationalize this theoretical framework, such as Landslide tracker mobile app, Amritakripa mobile app, social media data analysis, and community involvement. It also examines the difficulties found while applying the citizen science approach in two case study locations in India: Munnar in the Western Ghats and Chandmari in Sikkim. This chapter and the case study can help policymakers, community leaders, change makers, administrative officials, and researchers in disaster management.},

	abstract = {Due to the recent emergence of invasive mosquito species and the outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases in Europe, research on the ecology and diversity of the mosquito fauna has returned to scientific agendas. Through a nationwide surveillance programme in Germany, mosquitoes have been monitored actively by systematically operated traps since 2011, and passively by the ‘Mückenatlas’ (mosquito atlas) citizen science project launched in 2012. To assess the performance of both monitoring methods we compared the two respective datasets with regard to habitat coverage, species composition and the ability to detect invasive mosquitoes. The datasets include observations from the beginning of the project until the end of 2017. We found significant differences in species composition caused by land use types and the participants’ recording activity. Active monitoring performed better in mapping mosquito diversity, whereas passive monitoring better detected invasive species, thereby using data from private premises scientists usually cannot access. Synthesis and applications. Active and passive monitoring is complementary. Combining them allows for the determination of mosquito diversity, efficient detection of emerging invasive species and the initiation of rapid-response actions against such invaders. The ‘Mückenatlas’ sets an example for the usefulness of citizen science when included in a national monitoring programme, an approach that may be worth copying for tackling the global spread of arthropod vectors of disease agents.},

	abstract = {Software 2.0 refers to the fundamental shift in software engineering where using machine learning becomes the new norm in software with the availability of big data and computing infrastructure. As a result, many software engineering practices need to be rethought from scratch where data becomes a first-class citizen, on par with code. It is well known that 80--90\% of the time for machine learning development is spent on data preparation. Also, even the best machine learning algorithms cannot perform well without good data or at least handling biased and dirty data during model training. In this tutorial, we focus on data collection and quality challenges that frequently occur in deep learning applications. Compared to traditional machine learning, there is less need for feature engineering, but more need for significant amounts of data. We thus go through state-of-the-art data collection techniques for machine learning. Then, we cover data validation and cleaning techniques for improving data quality. Even if the data is still problematic, hope is not lost, and we cover fair and robust training techniques for handling data bias and errors. We believe that the data management community is well poised to lead the research in these directions. The presenters have extensive experience in developing machine learning platforms and publishing papers in top-tier database, data mining, and machine learning venues.},

Over the past decade and a half, we have seen the emergence of typologies, definitions, and criteria for qualifying citizen science. Yet, citizen science as a field seems somewhat resistant to obeying a limited set of definitions and instead attracts discussions about what type of activities and practices should be included in it. We explore how citizen science has been defined differently, depending on the context. We do that from a particularly European perspective, where the variety of national and subnational structures has also led to a diversity of practices. Based on this background, we track trade-offs linked to the prioritisation of these different objectives and aims of citizen science. Understanding these differences and their origin is important for practitioners and policymakers. We pay attention to the need for definitions and criteria for specific contexts and how people in different roles can approach the issue of what is included in a specific interpretation of citizen science.},

	abstract = {Within the academic and popular discussion of neogeography, it is routinely argued that the process of producing and using geographical information has been fundamentally democratised. Neogeography, in contrast to ‘established geography’, especially uses the argument that it is for anyone, anywhere, and anytime. Similar arguments have been used to praise the growth in Web {GIS} since the mid-1990s and seem to be persistent in the conceptualisation of these technologies. However, what is the nature of this democracy, and to what extent do the technologies that are used in neogeography fulfil this democratisation promise? In this contribution the framework offered by Andrew Feenberg in his critical theory of technology, and especially his call for ‘deep democratisation’, is used to provide a critique of these assertions of the nature of neogeography. The analysis shows that, unlike early critical {GIS} and the literature on participatory {GIS}, the analysis of neogeography adopted an instrumentalist interpretation of the technology and its applications. This view claims that technology is value free and that there is a separation between means and ends. This type of argument ignores and disguises the values that are integrated inexorably in advanced technologies. Once the values are exposed and discussed, neogeography becomes far less exciting and transformative. It becomes clear that there is a separation between a technological elite and a wider group of uninformed, labouring participants who are not empowered through the use of the technology. There are also multiple obstacles that limit the democratic potential of neogeography. The analysis progresses by considering the hierarchy of hacking, understood here as the ability to alter and change the meaning and use of a specific technological system. This hierarchy further explains the democratisation potentialities and limits of neogeography. Because of the reduced barriers, neogeography does offer some increased level of democratisation but, to fulfil this potential, it requires careful implementation that takes into account social and political aspects.},

	abstract = {Effective disaster relief efforts hinge on proactive community involvement empowered by scientific understanding and cutting-edge technological tools, throughout the disaster lifecycle, spanning pre-disaster preparations, during-disaster rescue and evacuations, and post-disaster relief and rehabilitation. Crowdsourced mobile applications have emerged as powerful tools to facilitate communication among stakeholders, including community members, non-governmental organizations ({NGOs}), local administrators, and government agencies. This paper showcases Amrita’s two crowdsourced apps: the Landslide Tracker app, a multilingual app designed to enable community members to document landslides with geo-tagging, images, and landslide characteristics, and the Amrita Kripa app, facilitating real-time communication between disaster victims and relief volunteers and agencies. The Amrita Kripa app enables victims to request rescue, supplies, medical assistance, and services, with requests geo-tagged and instantly communicated to all relevant stakeholders and relief providers. The present research involved the enhancement and deployment of these apps in a case study area of Sikkim, a Northeastern state of India, which is particularly vulnerable to multiple geohazards. This focused group research could examine the receptivity of these two apps among higher-secondary and undergraduate school students and faculty through a two-day workshop that has been revealed to be beneficial in strengthening their communication and cooperation to mitigate a possible calamity. This case study aims to illustrate a path forward for enhancing community resilience and effective engagement in disaster relief efforts.},

However, they encounter a significant challenge in the form of clouds and their shadows, which hinders the data acquisition and processing for regions of interest. This article undertakes a comprehensive literature review to systematically analyze the critical cloud-related challenges. It explores the need for accurate cloud detection, reviews existing datasets, and evaluates contemporary cloud detection methodologies, including their strengths and limitations. Additionally, it highlights the inaccuracies introduced by varying atmospheric and environmental conditions, emphasizing the importance of integrating advanced techniques that can utilize local and global semantics. The review also introduces a structured intercomparison framework to enable standardized evaluation across binary and multiclass cloud detection methods using both qualitative and quantitative metrics. To facilitate fair comparison, a conversion mechanism is highlighted to harmonize outputs across methods with different class granularities. By identifying gaps in current practices and datasets, the study highlights the importance of innovative, efficient, and scalable solutions for automated cloud detection, paving the way for unbiased evaluation and improved utilization of satellite imagery across diverse applications.},

	abstract = {Robust inventories are vital for improving assessment of and response to deadly and costly landslide hazards. However, collecting landslide events in inventories is difficult at the global scale due to inconsistencies in or the absence of landslide reporting. Citizen science is a valuable opportunity for addressing some of these challenges. The new Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository ({COOLR}) supplements data in a {NASA}-developed Global Landslide Catalog ({GLC}) with citizen science reports to build a more robust, publicly available global inventory. This manuscript introduces the {COOLR} project and its methods, evaluates the initial citizen science results from the first 13 months, and discusses future improvements to increase the global engagement with the project. The {COOLR} project (https://landslides.nasa.gov) contains Landslide Reporter, the first global citizen science project for landslides, and Landslide Viewer, a portal to visualize data from {COOLR} and other satellite and model products. From March 2018 to April 2019, 49 citizen scientists contributed 162 new landslide events to {COOLR}. These events spanned 37 countries in five continents. The initial results demonstrated that both expert and novice participants are contributing via Landslide Reporter. Citizen scientists are filling in data gaps through news sources in 11 different languages, in-person observations, and new landslide events occurring hundreds and thousands of kilometers away from any existing {GLC} data. The data is of sufficient accuracy to use in {NASA} susceptibility and hazard models. {COOLR} continues to expand as an open platform of landslide inventories with new data from citizen scientists, {NASA} scientists, and other landslide groups. Future work on the {COOLR} project will seek to increase participation and functionality of the platform as well as move towards collective post-disaster mapping.},

	abstract = {This research paper analyses the role and attitude of English and other languages in Nepal. It also sheds light on how the English language is being used in areas such as education, media and business. Nepal is a country rich in cultural and linguistic diversity. In this study, the lifestyle of the user, the current and political situation of the country, use of science and technology, politics, education and transportation have played a major role in the language use in Nepal. Over the last 50 - 60 years, the influence of English as a foreign language in the Nepalese education system has been increasing. The attraction of English has increased in such a way that it has become like a tradition to learn English before own mother tongue. Not only in school but parents are also eager to teach English to their children from home. Parents are constantly trying to improve their child’s English. Due to these elements, the world is shrinking or narrowing day by day. Nepal has not been able to remain untouched by this kind of problem. People seem to be motivated to learn English for economic, social, political, international relations and other benefits. Therefore, everyone is trying to enable their children by sending them to English medium schools. The fact that reading only in English medium has affected the learning of the local language has been brought out from this educational research. The research sought to highlight the increasing use of English language teaching in Nepal, the state of the language, language change due to the language policy of the Government of Nepal, and the possibility of languages dying due to language change. Textbooks, medium of examination, question papers, giving a lot of opportunities to students who know English have drawn everyone towards English. Multilingualism, language contact and language change are the fundamental experiences in Nepal. This paper is concerned with the language changing forms in Nepalese context based on Fishman’s (1991) Reversing Language Shift ({RLS}). This paper presents the problems, solutions and suggestions in four different sections. In the first section, the early stages of English education in Nepal are discussed. In the second section, the influence of foreign languages on the original language and culture is discussed. Third, the fact that English influence has increased in important places like available textbooks, exams and question papers, schools, offices etc. is presented in graphs and bars. The final section includes research findings, solutions, and recommendation.},
